        Ganesha:alson known as Ganpati and Vinayka,is one of yhe best-known and worshipped deities in hindu pantheon. <br><br>
        His image is found throughout India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bali (Indonesia), Malaysia, Philippines and Bangladesh and in countries with large ethnic Indian populations including Fiji, Mauritius and Trinidad and Tobago. <br><br>
         Hindu denominations worship him regardless of affiliations. Devotion to Ganesha is widely diffused and extends to Jains and Buddhists.
         <br><br>
         Although Ganesha has many attributes, he is readily identified by his elephant head. <br><br>
          He is widely revered, more specifically, as the remover of obstacles;
          the patron of arts and sciences; and the deva of intellect and wisdom. <br><br>
          As the god of beginnings, he is honoured at the start of rites and ceremonies.
         Ganesha is also invoked as patron of letters and learning during writing sessions. <br><br>
         Several texts relate mythological anecdotes associated with his birth and exploits. <br><br>
         An elephantâ€“headed anthropomorphic figure on Indo-Greek coins from the 1st century BCE has been proposed by some scholars to be "incipient Ganesha",
          while others have suggested Ganesha may have been an emerging deity in India and southeast Asia around the 2nd-century CE based on the evidence from archaeological excavations in Mathura and outside India. <br><br>
          Most certainly by the 4th and 5th centuries CE, during the Gupta period, Ganesha was well established and had inherited traits from Vedic and pre-Vedic precursors. <br><br>
           Hindu mythology identifies him as the restored son of Parvati and Shiva of the Shaivism tradition, but he is a pan-Hindu god found in its various traditions. <br><br>
            In the Ganapatya tradition of Hinduism, Ganesha is the supreme deity. The principal texts on Ganesha include the Ganesha Purana, the Mudgala Purana and the Ganapati Atharvashirsa. <br><br>
            Brahma Purana and Brahmanda Purana are other two Puranic genre encyclopaedic texts that deal with Ganesh.
